This contains a set of default workers designed to ease the
development of the Remote Workers. All of these workers 
should be cross platform.

Specialise workers for certains platforms should be placed in another
project than this one.

====================================================================

-- SimpleTestWorker: Simple worker to use for tests! Generates a 
simple html file as output and that's all and simple test worker
abides to the standard workers must abide to. Use this worker
to check if basic functionality works.

-- NastyBadWorker: Complex worker that respects the standards for
workers but functions unproperly in many other ways. Here are the 
following things this worker does to stress test the system:
	  * Use python a non-compiled (non-optimal) language
	  * Creates a lot of files (100 files)
	  * Each file created has 1 MB of content
	  * The worker creates non standard html files
	  * The worker wastes time at startup (1 second)

This worker should be use for stress testing

==== DESCRIPTION ====

ControlUnit refers to the part of the program that handles the workers
i.e the laptop/dekstop/server end of the software.

Commander refers to the part of the program that handles generating
requests to the laptop/desktop/server.

Templates are simple files to speed-up the development.

Workers are a set of default workers and they are built here.

Each subsystem contains a test framework.

==== CMAKE CONFIGURATION GUIDE ====

Use the CMakeLists.txt in each subdirectory to create either component
of the software.

In other words choose in the CMake GUI the right subdirectory as the
source directory.

To use the test framework go to the "Tests" subdirectory of the
subsystem subdirectory. For instance to build the Tests for the
ControlUnit choose as source directory the directory
ControlUnit/Tests.
